The process must process three parameters via the robocluod work item
  - search phrase
  - news category/section/topic
  - number of months for which you need to receive news (if applicable)
    
    >   Example of how this should work: 0 or 1 - only the current month, 2 - current and previous month, 3 - current and two previous months, and so on
    > 

These may be defined within a configuration file, but weâ€™d prefer they be provided via a [Robocloud workitem](https://rpaframework.org/libraries/robocorp_workitems/)
